# 2.1.0

Added zone based listing of machines. - Thanks @v92

Prefixed the Ansible groups with "zone-" or "tag-" to prevent naming conflicts.

# 2.0.1

Only return machines that are in "Deployed" status to Ansible. - Thanks @v92

# 2.0.0

Reworked some of the code, added extra features and made compatibility changes
so it works for MAAS API 2.0.

Dropped support for MAAS API 1.0 as MAAS itself no longer supports it.

# 0.1.0

Original version written around August 28th, 2015 for MAAS API version 1.0 by
